By crafting requests with conflicting Transfer-Encoding headers, attackers can bypass security restrictions and access restricted endpoints. This issue is due to Gunicorn's handling of Transfer-Encoding headers, where it incorrectly processes requests with multiple, conflicting Transfer-Encoding headers, treating them as chunked regardless of the final encoding specified. This vulnerability has been shown to allow access to endpoints restricted by gunicorn. This issue has been addressed in version 22.0.0.  To be affected users must have a network path which does not filter out invalid requests. These users are advised to block access to restricted endpoints via a firewall or other mechanism if they are unable to update."}, {"id": "CVE-2024-6827", "fix_versions": ["22.0.0"], "aliases": ["GHSA-hc5x-x2vx-497g"], "description": "Gunicorn version 21.2.0 does not properly validate the value of the 'Transfer-Encoding' header as specified in the RFC standards, which leads to the default fallback method of 'Content-Length,' making it vulnerable to TE.CL request smuggling.
